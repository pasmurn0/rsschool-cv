## About me
I am a 24 y.o. beginner Frontend Developer from Saints-Petersburg.
I have a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Far Eastern Federal University. However, I was always into computer science, therefore I dropped my job as chemical engineering laboratory employee in order to immerse in Frontend Development learning.
My major goal for now is to put all my efforts in finishing RS School successfully which might be a great help in finding a job position with a lot of prospects.
